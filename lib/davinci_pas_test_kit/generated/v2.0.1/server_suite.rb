      description %(
        The Da Vinci PAS Server Suite validates the conformance of server systems 
        to the STU 2 version of the HL7速 FHIR速 
        [Da Vinci Prior Authorization Support Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-pas/STU2/).

        These tests are a **DRAFT** intended to allow PAS server implementers to perform 
        preliminary checks of their servers against PAS IG requirements and [provide 
        feedback](https://github.com/inferno-framework/davinci-pas-test-kit/issues) 
        on the tests. Future versions of these tests may validate other 
        requirements and may change the test validation logic.

        The best place to get started is the [Server Testing
        Walkthrough](https://github.com/inferno-framework/davinci-pas-test-kit/wiki/Server-Walkthrough),
        which provides a step-by-step guide for running the tests against a client and provides
        an example client implemented in Postman.  Visit the [Server Testing
        Details](https://github.com/inferno-framework/davinci-pas-test-kit/wiki/Server-Details)
        documentation for information about technical implementation and known limitations of these tests.

        Inferno will simulate a client and make a series of prior authorization requests to the 
        server under test. Over the course of these requests, Inferno will seek to observe
        conformant handling of PAS requirements, including
        - The ability of the server to use PAS API interactions to communicate 
            - Approval of a prior authorization request
            - Denial of a prior authorization request
            - Pending of a prior authorization request and a subsequent final decision
            - Inability to process a prior authorization request
        - The ability of the server to handle the full scope of data required by PAS, including
            - Ability to process prior auth requests and inquiries with all PAS profiles and all must support elements on those profiles
            - Ability to return responses that demonstrate the use of all PAS profiles and all must support elements on those profiles

        Because the business logic that determines decisions and the elements populated in responses
        Is outside of the PAS specification and will vary between implementers, testers
        are required to provide the requests that Inferno will make to the server.

        All requests and responses will be checked for conformance to the PAS
        IG requirements individually and used in aggregate to determine whether
        required features and functionality are present. HL7速 FHIR速 resources are 
        validated with the Java validator using `tx.fhir.org` as the terminology server.
